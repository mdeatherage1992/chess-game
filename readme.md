Welcome to the Chess Wizard!

In this application you can input a Queen, Knight, or Rook & a position on the Chess board, and
you will receive an alert from the wizard with the piece's possible moves!

Be sure to have your console open, as if you make a typo or input something wonky, we will let you
know about it !

If you would like to run the application, simply copy the index path, and paste into your browser!

If you would like to take a look at the test specs, simply copy the SpecRunner.html path and take
a look!


Happy Chessing!
